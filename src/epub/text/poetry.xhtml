			<h2 epub:type="title">Clever Class Poem</h2>
			<p>
				<span>Up Learning’s ladder, round by round</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We’ve climbed with many a fall;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But, through the toil, companionship</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Has made amends for all.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now from our giddy heights we glance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With calm thoughts and serene,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Once more at those we leave today⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Our class of sweet sixteen.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I want to take you with me through</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The ranks of our small crowd;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, if you’ll listen carefully,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">You’ll know why we are proud.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Grace, as our goodly president</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Has served her second year;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In singing, speaking, poetry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She stands without a peer.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Blanche is the sunshine of our class,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She drives dull care away</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her laughing eyes, her smiling face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Have gladdened many a day.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Alice, the calm, the dignified,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I know we’ll ne’er forget;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her views are wide⁠—but, best of all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She is the teacher’s pet.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lena excels in whispering.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Few are the notes she writes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She studies hard throughout the day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For pleasure, saves her nights.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Belle was the star in physics class,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She always knew the laws</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when she failed to know a thing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She always had a cause.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Anna has graced our piano stool,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And mingled tunes with laughter;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ah, well, one can be young but once,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The frowns may come hereafter.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ruth is a clever, pretty girl,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So everyone remarks,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet lives in constant danger⁠—what?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The danger of her “Sparks.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Will is the pride of all the girls,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The slave of every teacher,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When someone wants a window closed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She calls on “Jube,” poor creature.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Clayt is the lad who’s in to win,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He is the teachers’ boy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And though at times his face is sad,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His heart is full of “Joy.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Gertie has made a record proud,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She seldom failed in class,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She studied hard these last four years</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And well deserved to pass.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Bertha, the singer of our class,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How diligent she’s been!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She did her share of whispering,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But then that’s not a sin.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Bess is the class historian,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That office, well, she’ll fill.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She’s “Sortore” set in all her ways,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And has an iron “Will.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lawrence is the one who thinks</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He’s been our comrade long;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His fav’rite stone, an “Opal” bright</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He’s blest with an “Arm strong.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Sweet Genevieve has worked and toiled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her honor’s justly won,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And every teacher in our school</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will say her work’s well “Dunn.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And now there’s only one remains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He should have come before;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His name is John, his hopes all lie</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In a corner grocery store.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And now, I’ve mentioned everyone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I hope no one feels slighted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But if one does, let him approach,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His wrong will soon be righted.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At last your poet ends his lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He’s nothing more to tell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But leaves the class of nineteen-one</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With blessing and farewell.</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">A Visit from Young Gloom</h3>
				<p>
					<span>There’s been a young stranger at our house,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A baby whom nobody knew;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who hated his brother, his father, his mother,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And made them aware of it, too.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He stayed with us nearly a fortnight</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And carried a grouch all the while,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor promise nor present could make him look pleasant;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He hadn’t the power to smile.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He cried when he couldn’t have something;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He cried just as hard when he could;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Kind words by the earful but made him more tearful,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And scoldings did just as much good.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He stormed when his meals weren’t ready,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when they <em>were</em> ready, he screamed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He went to bed growling, got up again howling</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And quarreled and snarled as he dreamed.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He’s gone, and the child we are fond of</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is back, just as nice as of old.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But I hope to be in some port European</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The next time he has a bad cold.</span>

				<p>
					<span>My son, I wish that it were half</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As easy to extract a laugh</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From grown-ups as from thee.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then I’d go on the stage, my boy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While Richard Carle and Eddie Foy</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Burned up with jealousy.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I wouldn’t have to rack my brain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or lie awake all night in vain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pursuit of brand new jokes;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor fear my lines were heard with groans</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of pain and sympathetic moans</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From sympathetic folks.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I’d merely have to make a face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Just twist a feature out of place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And be the soul of wit;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or bark, and then pretend to bite,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, from the screams of wild delight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be sure I’d made a hit.</span>

					<span>He couldn’t have a doughnut, and it made him very mad;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He undertook to get revenge by screaming at his dad.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Cut out that noise!” I ordered, and he gave another roar,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so I put him in “the room” and shut and locked the door.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I left him in his prison cell two minutes, just about,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, penitent, he smiled at me when I did let him out.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But when he got another look at the forbidden fruit</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He gave a yell that they could hear in Jacksonville or Butte.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Cut out that noise!” I barked again. “Cut out that foghorn stuff!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Perhaps I didn’t leave you in your prison long enough.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“You want your dad to keep you jailed all afternoon, I guess.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He smiled at me and answered his equivalent for “yes.”</span>

					<br/>
					<span>To have as guests at ev’ry meal</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Well, that’s the case with me, but still</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I don’t complain or holler,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For, strange to say, the groc’ry bill</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>These guests of ours, to make it brief,</span>

					<span>Perhaps in some respects it’s true</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That you resemble dad;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To be informed I look like you</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would never make me mad.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But one thing I am sure of, son,</span>

					<span class="i1">You have a different line</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of humor, your idea of fun</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is not a bit like mine.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>You drop my slippers in the sink</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And leave them there to soak.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That’s very laughable, you think</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But I can’t see the joke</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You take my hat outdoors with you</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And fill it full of earth;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You seem to think that’s witty, too,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But I’m not moved to mirth.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>You open up the chicken-yard;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Its inmates run a mile;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You giggle, but I find it hard</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To force one-half a smile.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No, kid, I fear your funny stuff,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Though funny it may be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is not quite delicate enough</span>

				<p>
					<span>Since he began to talk and sing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’ve learned one interesting thing⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The value of a verb is small;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In fact, it has no worth at all.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Why waste the breath required to say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“While toddling through the park today,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw a bird up in a tree,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When “Twee, pahk, birt,” does splendidly?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Why should one say, “Please pass the bread,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When “Ba-ba me” is easier said?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And why “I’m starved. Have supper quick,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When “<strong>lunch</strong>!” yelled loudly, does the trick?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Why “I’ve been riding on a train,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When “Bye-bye, Choo-choo” makes it plain?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Let words be few,” the poet saith,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>The people marvelled at nerve so great</span>

					<br/>
					<span>More daring each day than the day before,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>He boasted: “I’m one that they’ll never get.”</span>

				<span class="i1">How Alfred Stout, who was down and out,</span>

				<span>David⁠—he is my youngest son;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There are, you know, three others⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Appears to think it’s not much fun</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To only just have brothers.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He likes them all, you understand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But there is this objection:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They don’t wear pretty dresses and</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They don’t crave his affection.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So he has added to the fold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A little sister, “Bessie.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She’s just his age⁠—that’s three years old⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And very awful dressy.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet she’s not vain, but seems to be</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of rather shy demeanor;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Outside of Dave, her family</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have not so much as seen her.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Which we regret, for as I say</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her clothes are awful pretty.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They come in truckloads every day</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From stores in New York City.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But all the clothes and all the toys</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which David says he’s bought her</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are held as the exclusive joys</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of him and my new daughter.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For them and her, we take his word;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Twere imbecile to flout him.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hell has no fury like this bird</span>

				<span>When you presume to doubt him!</span>

			<p>
				<span>When Davey, my kid, takes a tumble</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And gets an abrasion or two,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If you dare sympathize, he coolly replies:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“It’s what I was trying to do.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When he smashes a toy he was fond of</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or bursts a balloon that’s brand new,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He’ll throw it away and brazenly say:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“It’s what I was trying to do.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That’s Dave’s philosophical system,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And I think I will follow it, too;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When I foozle and err, I will boldly aver</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It’s what I was trying to do.</span>

				<span>So, ye who don’t like these two pages,</span>

				<span>If ye say to me, “Fool, you have written plain drool”⁠—</span>

				<span>I hardly ever see a roof</span>

				<span>I hardly ever pass a tree</span>

				<span>Before we had money, we lived in a flat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The dear little woman and I.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There wasn’t no danger of us getting fat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the cellar was painfully dry.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But though we now boast of a house in Duluth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And go there in passenger coaches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That house, it don’t seem like the home of our youth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For a home ain’t a home without roaches.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>We now have twelve slaves at our beck and our call,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Navajo rugs on the floor;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A platinum hat rack stands out in the hall;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There’s a pearl-studded knob on the door.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweet mother goes round with a mouthful of gold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wears South American brooches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But somehow she ain’t the same gal as of old⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And a home ain’t a home without roaches.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The house that we live in has vermin enough</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To satisfy most folks’s taste.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In fact, many servants have quit in a huff</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With bites from the neck to the waist.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The mice and the rats and the weasels crowd in</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By thousands as winter approaches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And mother and I⁠—well, we bear it and grin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But a home ain’t a home without roaches.</span>
